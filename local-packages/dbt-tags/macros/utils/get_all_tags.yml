      ```sql
      {% raw %}
      {% set tags = dbt_tags.get_all_tags() %}
      {% endraw %}
      ```

      **Output Dict**: `tags` will result as a dict which represented for 1 dbt tags
      ```json
      {
        "level": <indicates model or column level>, 
        "name": <model name or column name>, 
        "tag": <dbt tag>
      }
